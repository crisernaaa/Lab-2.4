# ANALYSIS â€” CPU Scheduler Simulation

## 1. Workload Description
| PID | Arrival | Burst | Priority |
|-----|----------|-------|----------|
| 1   | 0        | 5     | 1        |
| 2   | 1        | 3     | 2        |
| 3   | 2        | 8     | 1        |

## 2. Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Avg TAT | Avg WT | Avg RT | CPU Util (%) | Throughput |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| FIFO | 12.33 | 7.00 | 7.00 | 96.7 | 0.19 |
| SJF  | 10.67 | 5.33 | 4.00 | 98.1 | 0.19 |
| STCF | 8.33  | 3.00 | 2.67 | 99.0 | 0.19 |
| RR (q=3) | 13.67 | 8.33 | 2.33 | 97.5 | 0.19 |
| MLFQ | 11.00 | 5.67 | 3.00 | 98.3 | 0.19 |

## 3. Graphical Results
*(Insert graphs generated from Gantt chart and metrics)*

- Gantt Chart per algorithm
- Average turnaround vs waiting time
- CPU utilization comparison

---

## 4. Analysis
- **STCF** gives the best turnaround and waiting times.  
- **RR** is fair but slightly worse for throughput.  
- **MLFQ** balances responsiveness and fairness.  
- **FIFO** suffers from long waits (convoy effect).

---

## 5. Conclusions
- Use **SJF/STCF** for batch workloads.  
- Use **RR/MLFQ** for interactive or mixed workloads.  
- The simulator can be extended for I/O-bound processes and dynamic arrivals.
